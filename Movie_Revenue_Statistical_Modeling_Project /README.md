# Movie Revenue Statistical Modeling Project Summary

This is a group project from a Statistics course taken as part of my Master's degree. It explores what factors contribute to a higher movie revenue. 
The "src" folder houses cleaning scripts and contains the data that was used. The analysis was conducted in "R" and the .R file is provided as well
as the knit .pdf version for readability. The final report addresses assumptions made about the data, data exploration, the models we interated through and final metrics.
